# ClipGrab
Copying Clips from the Clipboard
by: Themanhimself115

This is a short python Project i made in cyber security and just in general for hacking and spying on a computer.

This code utilizes multiple specific steps that make it decently made and overall a basic project for beginners.

-------------

steps:

1. the program reads any incoming clipboard Copy&Paste

2. the Copy&Paste clipboard is then saved to the text file to be read.

3. After some time, the loop in the program would then read the file and extract the text

4. The text from the Txt file is then sent and webhook url and the txt file is erased for more data to be stored.

-------------

How to use:

Its pretty simple, just locate the "webhook_url" variable and add your webhook Url
to access and locate your webhook url (if you never used it) you can find it here --> webhook.site.

If you dont like using the file Clips.txt, you can replace it you what ever txt file you want, just make sure its in the same directory as the python file and make sure the value for your filename variable is 

filename = "<filename>.txt" instead of filename = "<filename>"

-------------

Use as you want i dont really care...

Thinking about it now, i think its best i should have made a list inside the python code instead of it using an external Txt file.
